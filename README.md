# lien

**Tokenized real-world assets you can borrow against — with on-chain compliance.**

`lien` is a full-stack RWA credit protocol: a permissioned, NAV-bearing token that
represents a real-world asset (e.g. tokenized T-bills), wrapped in subscription /
redemption flows, and usable as **collateral in an isolated lending market** so
holders can borrow stablecoins **without redeeming** — the protocol takes a *lien*
on the tokenized asset.

> Portfolio project (EVM / RWA). Built EVM-native (Foundry + viem/wagmi) as the
> transferable counterpart to my TRON lending work — the full-stack pattern moves
> from TronWeb to viem as an interface swap, not a rewrite.

## Why it's interesting (the hard parts)

- **Compliance as a first-class concern.** The RWA token is *permissioned* (KYC
  allowlist + transfer restrictions + agent powers: freeze / forceTransfer /
  recovery — required by regulation, with the centralization trade-off discussed
  honestly). A faithful, focused subset of the ERC-3643 model.
- **NAV oracle = the asset's truth.** Off-chain valuation pushed on-chain with
  staleness + circuit-breaker guards; yield accrues via NAV appreciation. An RWA
  oracle carries more responsibility than a DeFi price feed.
- **Liquidating *permissioned* collateral.** A liquidator seizing the RWA token
  must itself be eligible to hold it. Three designs are compared (liquidator
  allowlist / seize-to-forced-redemption / protocol custody); one is implemented.
- **Isolated lending core, reused.** The market is built on a vendored Morpho Blue
  engine, so the work concentrates on the RWA differentiators above.

## How it works

The depositor journey, and the mechanism behind each step:

1. **Get allowlisted.** The RWA token (`tBILL`) is *permissioned* — an agent KYC-verifies
   your address in the `IdentityRegistry`. Only verified addresses may hold or receive it
   (enforced on-chain in the token's transfer hook, ERC-3643-style).
2. **Subscribe.** Deposit USDC → the `SubscriptionManager` mints `tBILL` at the current
   **NAV** (Net Asset Value per share, pushed on-chain by the `NavOracle`). Decimals are
   handled explicitly (6-dec USDC ↔ 18-dec tBILL ↔ 1e18 NAV), rounding in the protocol's
   favor.
3. **Earn yield.** Yield accrues as NAV rises above $1.00 (e.g. a T-bill accruing interest) —
   your position's USD value grows without any token rebasing.
4. **Borrow against it.** Post `tBILL` as collateral in the isolated lending market (a
   vendored Morpho Blue engine) and **borrow USDC without selling** — the protocol takes a
   *lien* on your tokenized asset. The **Health Factor** = LTV-weighted collateral ÷ debt;
   above 1.0 is safe, below 1.0 is liquidatable. The NAV→Morpho oracle adapter is
   **fail-safe**: a stale/circuit-broken NAV freezes the market rather than pricing off a
   dead feed.
5. **Liquidation of permissioned collateral.** If a position goes underwater, anyone can
   liquidate it through the `LiquidationRouter` — a KYC'd contract with a USDC buffer that
   receives the seized `tBILL`, fronts the repayment, and pays the keeper the incentive in
   USDC. So liquidation stays permissionless and capital-free even though the collateral
   itself can only be held by verified addresses. (Three designs are compared in the
   [ADRs](contracts/docs/合规设计.md).)
6. **Redeem.** Burn `tBILL` → the USDC owed is locked at the current NAV and **queued**; after
   a **T+N** settlement delay you `claim` it (real funds settle on a schedule, not instantly).
   The UI surfaces your pending redemptions with a live countdown and a Claim button that
   unlocks once settled — and `withdrawProceeds` can never dip into the reserve backing those
   queued claims.
7. **Or deposit into the curated vault.** Prefer hands-off, diversified exposure?
   `LienVault` (ERC-4626, MetaMorpho-style) takes your USDC and a curator allocates it
   across multiple isolated RWA markets under per-market caps; yield accrues to depositors.

Every privileged/agent action emits an auditable event; the trust boundary is documented
honestly rather than hidden.

buffer + redemption liquidity). NAV $1.00. Run `pnpm --filter @lien/web dev` and
connect a Base Sepolia wallet.

To interact (subscribe / borrow) a wallet must be KYC-verified by the agent — the
permission model is the point. Reads (NAV, positions) work for anyone.
